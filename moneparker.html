                The patterned fabrics pile up in a kaleidoscope of color while resting in a bin in Moné Parker’s dorm room closet. Prevailing shades of purple are carried through the storage box. What started as volunteering at Quilt Museum in Downtown Harrisonburg has turned into her own small business on Etsy that sells masks, laptop and phone cases, chainmail bracelets, and sketchbooks. <br><br> 
 
                When Parker was in elementary school, she created imaginary friends and took up origami as a habit. She’d fold the colorful scraps of paper and what started as one origami kit turned into a habit of buying up papers. <br><br>

                “I'm a crafter,” Parker said. “I love making things with my hands.”<br><br>

                Now a senior architectural design major at JMU, Parker found herself in a similar position to when she was a kid last spring when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. She had ample free time and filled it with crafting— lots of crafting. So much crafting that she decided to sell her art to prevent the projects from turning her into a “hoarder.” She worked for three months before launching her online shop at Etsy in July to ensure she had the proper research on prices and materials. <br><br>

                At least three times a week, Parker can be found volunteering at the Quilt Museum in Downtown Harrisonburg to fulfill a requirement of her status in JMU centennial scholar program since her freshman year. There, she learned to quilt and discovered the magic of the stash box, a bin full of fabric sold by the pound rather than the yard, making it cheaper. <br><br>

                The museum provided Parker with some fabric for free. For two years, she’d come home every semester with two or three boxes stuffed with fabric. Parker prefers colorful fabrics that remind her of “sweets,” over more plain options.  <br><br>

                Besides providing Parker with supplies, the Museum has also commissioned bookmarks from Parker and displays her business card. Museum employees have helped Parker with technical problems on her sewing machine.<br><br>

                Parker’s favorite product to make, colorful sketchbooks, were inspired by generic sketchbooks in her classes. For Parker, sewing each product takes 5 or 6 hours and provides a break. <br><br>

                “I just use it for relaxation when I’m over doing schoolwork,” Parker said.<br><br>  

                What started as a way to fill free time during the lockdown, has proved to be fulfilling for Parker. One mom bought sketchbooks for her two sons; the little customers mailed Parker a postcard with their drawings to thank her. One featured a dragon and the other had three flowers.  <br><br>

                “That almost made me cry,” Parker said. “That is why I make this stuff for people because that was amazing.”<br><br>

                One of Parker’s favorite parts of her Etsy store products is the ability for customers to customize the products. <br><br>

                “They just designed it and they just get what they envisioned,” Parker said. “ It's so satisfying to see something come into fruition.”<br><br>

                While Parker has made many smaller projects for her store, Parker’s first big sewing project was a reversible tote bag. In the long term, she hopes to add a bullet planner, which is a cross between a planner and a journal, and the tote bag to her store. <br><br>

                “It's still being creative, but you're using creativity to be productive and actually functional,” Parker said. “Not just making art to put on a wall.”
