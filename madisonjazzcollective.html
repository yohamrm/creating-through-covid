                Noah Galbreath recalled a recent gig where a woman and man sitting near the stage were visibly grooving to the smooth jazz music. He wondered if they were musicians and said he often sparks conversations with audience members who seem captivated after the show. <br><br>
 
                “I think that kind of interaction with people is what makes it the most worth it for me,” Galbreath said.  <br><br>

                Live music is a rare event during COVID-19, as playing instruments oftentimes requires removing one’s mask, but The Madison Jazz Collective has performed live in downtown Harrisonburg since last fall. <br><br>

                Kyle Fauber, a senior media arts and design major, plays alto sax. Galbreath, a fifth year music education major, plays tenor sax and sometimes hops on the drums at gigs. <br><br>

                The pair have been making music together for 8 years, since their middle and high school days. Fauber and Galbreath filled a gap at Clementine's after the previous jazz students who played downtown graduated. <br><br>

                The two often invite their musician friends to play with them. The Madison Jazz Collective doesn’t typically rehearse, instead relying on jazz standards that they all know. <br><br>

                “There's a big book of them that some of us carry around,” Fauber said. “If we call a tune, then everyone should know and we could just play it off the bat without even having to have music in front of us.” <br><br>

                Some of their less musical friends think jazz music is boring when listening to a recording, but change their tune when seeing the band live. Fauber compared their jazz performances to the movie “La La Land” when Ryan Gosling’s character explains the genre to Emma Stone’s character by telling her to look at the chemistry on stage.<br><br>

                “You can see the interactions on stage,” Fauber said. “You can see the music really being brought back to life by people of the same age.”<br><br>

                Galbreath is a student teacher with middle schoolers and said his students are often fascinated by the sounds different instruments make. He said the audience at Clementine's often has a similar reaction when hearing live music. <br><br>

                “You actually hear saxophones and trumpets and stuff in tons of pop music, but it's mixed in this way where it's not the forefront,” Galbreath said. “I think some of it is like interacting with instruments you didn't even really think could be played that way.”<br><br>

                Both Fauber and Galbreath hope to keep jazz in their lives after graduating. Fauber said he loves the energy and vibe with the audience at Clementine. <br><br>

                “Promoting jazz music and just having a good time, seeing someone down there who's really into it,” Fauber said. “One person can change the whole show." </p>
