                The original stained glass window from 1926 illuminates the street of downtown, grabbing the attention of local theatre lovers looking for a show. Old buildings became money pits and eventually unimportant to the city, including the theatre. Ever since reopening almost 90 years later, the Wayne Theatre has revitalized the downtown scene and art culture of Waynesboro. <br><br>

                Tracy Straight, the theatre’s executive director, took on the project of restoring the Wayne in 1998 as a way of giving a gift back to the community. <br><br>

                “We just started gathering people, we called ourselves the Friends of the Wayne, and had little barbecues at different people's homes and invited people just to come and talk about it,” Straight said. “And that's how it all started.” <br><br>

                In 2000, Straight and the volunteers formed the Wayne Theatre Alliance to prevent the building from being demolished. The group incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 2002 and that’s when donations started pouring in. They raised $4 million, the largest amount a nonprofit has ever raised in Waynesboro. <br><br>

                “We knew this project was going to take more funding than what we could raise as volunteers,” Straight said. “With this assistance and gathering more people, we sought out historic tax credits and were one of the first projects in the United States to do New Market Tax Credit.”<br><br>

                The Wanye began to expand its properties by acquiring a storefront in 2012 and then transforming it into a small venue with a thrust stage that could host 120 people.<br><br>

                “It was a way for us to really dip our toes more into providing arts for people and something to give people a reason to come back downtown,” said Straight. “We called it the Gateway, because it was the gateway to finally opening the Wayne Theatre.”<br><br>

                On March 1, 2016 the Wayne Theatre officially reopened, and now offers a wide variety of performances, film showings and classes.The theatre offers a minimum of 10 free events a month.<br><br>

                “We just have a jar at the front that says: pay what you will,” Straight said.  Some people put something into a jar, some don’t, but they are still just as welcome,” Straight said.<br><br>

                Now, the Wayne is more established, and Straight sees a window of opportunity to expand the Wayne’s presence in the coming years. The theatre is planning an extension called ‘The Wayne Campus’ or ‘The Hillside’  marking the start of their next capital campaign. The property, by Harvest Church, will become the Wayne’s by the end of the month and will host classes and meetings.<br><br>

                “Then we have the hilltop house, which takes us to the end of the block,” Straight said.“In the future that'd be a wonderful place for apartments, boutiques, hotels, a place where we bring in artists.” <br><br>

                Despite the theatre temporarily shutting its doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Straight never gave up on her goal of providing the Wayne experience. Straight and her staff were able to maintain their connection with the community by offering their weekly events in a virtual atmosphere. Fortunately, the Wayne will be offering virtual and in-person opportunities for their upcoming production of The Wizard of Oz.<br><br>

                “I just could not be more proud of them, and their talent and their work,” Straight said. “I'm thankful that we are an outlet or a venue or another space where they can share their time and their talents and their art form.”<br><br>
