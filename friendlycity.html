                    The late evening light illuminates the high-ceilinged space, the large mirrors along the wall reflecting specks of sun. A small group huddles in the corner ready for their Kizomba class. The instruction begins and the students line up across from each other as the instructor reviews the basics. As they stumble through the steps, the instructor hypes them up, encouraging the pairs to continue as they let out nervous giggles. Latin beats pound through the studio and the dancers’ hips begin to move.<br><br>

                    The Friendly City Dance Room, located across from Court Square in downtown Harrisonburg, hosts urban dance classes every weeknight for those looking to learn something new or brush up on their moves. Phillip Fusaro, the Dance Room’s founder and owner, started the business in March of 2019 after seeing a need in the community. He said he hoped to help people form friendships in a unique way no matter their reason for walking into a dance class.<br><br>

                    “The ultimate goal of this place is not necessarily to train great dancers — though, we definitely do that,” Fusaro said. “But the primary goal is to provide people a way to connect.”<br><br>

                    Fusaro’s dance career began at the age of 9 when he started contra dance classes. In his experience, contra was a formal style requiring “coat and tails,” but he later learned it more commonly entails “straw hats, overalls and cowboy boots.” At 12 years old, Fusaso started taking ballroom dance classes and three years later he was hired by his studio as an instructor. <br><br>

                    “I've always had a joy for music and just loved grooving to it,” Fusaro said. “Even if I look super ridiculous.”<br><br>

                    While the studio offers a variety of styles of dance including kizomba, hip hop, bachata and swing dance, Fusaro said all classes feature his own “dad jokes” and lots of laughs. The classes are structured to begin with warm-ups, followed by developing footwork and forming partner connections before moving to a more advanced technique. <br><br>

                    “There's just this beautiful thing about the human body structure,” Fusaro said. “We just understand that movement, and we're able to respond to it.”<br><br>

                    Although Fusaro said he’ll never lose his love for performing, he’s found a lot of joy in teaching and running his own business. <br><br>

                    “I finally started teaching, I started building relationships with my students. I was like, ‘Oh, wow, this is actually really satisfying work,’” Fusaro said. “You get to meet people, you get to make relationships with them. You send them on their way with a smile on their face.”</p>
